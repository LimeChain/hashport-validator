# Scripts

## Setup bridge
1. Run bridge-setup.go with privateKey, accountId and network as flags to generate the configurations
    `go run ./scripts/bridge/setup.go --privateKey=/your private key/ --accountID=/your account id/ --adminKey=/your admin key/ --network=/previewnet|testnet|mainnet/ --members=/int, the count of the wanted bridge custodians/`

2. Run create.go to create custom token and associate it with hedera
   `go run ./scripts/token/native/create.go --privateKey=/your private key/ --accountID=/your account id/ --network=/previewnet|testnet|mainnet/ --memberPrKeys=/'The array of private keys from from the output of the previous step separated by ","'/ --bridgeID=/The bridge id from the output of the previous step/`

3. Run wrapped-token-create.go to create custom wrapped token with a bridge account treasury and associate it with hedera
   `go run ./scripts/token/wrapped/wrapped-token-create.go --privateKey=/your private key/ --accountID=/your account id/ --adminKey=/your admin key/ --network=/previewnet|testnet|mainnet/ --memberPrKeys=/'The array of private keys from from the output of the previous step separated by ","'/ --bridgeID=/The bridge id from the output of the previous step/ --generateSupplyKeysFromMemberPrKeys=true`

4. Associate new account to token
   `go run ./scripts/token/associate/associate.go --privateKey=/your private key/ --accountID=/your account id/ --network=/previewnet|testnet|mainnet/ --tokenID=/The Token id from the output of the previous step/`

## Update bridge config
1. Run create-topic.go (only once) with supplyKeys, executorAccountID, executorPrivateKey, keyThreshold, network to create the topic with all given public keys and the key threshold.
   `go run ./scripts/common/create-topic/create-topic.go --supplyKeys /public keys, split by comma/ --executorAccountID /executor account id/ --executorAccountID /executor private key/ --keyThreshold /key threshold (default: 1)/ --network /previewnet|testnet|mainnet/`

2. Run prepare-update-config.go with executorAccountID, topicID and configPath to create frozen transaction as bytes which to send for signing to all members
   `go run ./scripts/common/sign/sign-transaction.go --privateKeys /private keys, which need to sign the transaction, separated by comma/ --transaction /transaction bytes/`

3. Depending on the threshold, n out of m keys of the threshold supply key have to sign the generated bytes by running sign-transaction.go with privateKeys and transaction itself
   `go run ./scripts/common/sign/sign-transaction.go --privateKeys /member private key (or all members private keys separated by comma/ --transaction /transaction bytes/`

4. Submit the transaction after it has been signed by the required keys, by running submit-transaction.go with privateKey, accountID, network and transaction (the signed bytes)
   `go run ./scripts/common/submit/submit-transaction.go --privateKey /private key of executor/ --accountID /account id of the executor/ --network=/previewnet|testnet|mainnet/ --transaction /signed transaction bytes/`
