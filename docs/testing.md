# Testing

## E2E Testing

Before you run E2E tests, you need to have a running application.

### Configuration

Configure properties, needed to run e2e tests in `e2e/setup/application.yml` and `e2e/setup/bridge.yml`.
**Keep in mind that most of the configuration needs to be the same as the application's**.

Configuration for `e2e/setup/application.yml`:

### Run E2E Tests

```
go test ./e2e
```
`NB!` E2E tests are tightly coupled with the setup of [Three Validators Network](../examples/three-validators/README.md).
